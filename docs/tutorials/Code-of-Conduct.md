## Contributor Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of the Hoverboard project, we pledge to respect everyone who contributes by posting issues, updating documentation, submitting pull requests, providing feedback in comments, creating issues and any other activities.

Communication must be constructive and never resort to personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.

Project maintainers are responsible to extend courtesy and respect to everyone involved in this project regardless of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, age, race, ethnicity, religion, or level of experience. We expect anyone contributing to the Hoverboard project to do the same.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
