# Configure your app with Firebase

In case to have Authentication and My Schedule features, you'll need a Firebase project and your specific configuration data that has a few details about your project.

1. Create a Firebase project in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/), if you don't already have one.

	- If you already have an existing Google project associated with your app, click *Import Google Project*. Otherwise, click *Create New Project*.
	- If you already have a Firebase project, click *Add App* from the project overview page.

1. Click *Add Firebase to your web app*.
1. *Copy* all needed data, then paste it in `config/development.json` (and `config/production.json` if you use the same project in production). This configuration looks like this:

```json
"firebase": {
  "apiKey": "<REPLACE_ME>",
  "authDomain": "<REPLACE_ME>",
  "databaseURL": "<REPLACE_ME>",
  "projectId": "<REPLACE_ME>",
  "storageBucket": "<REPLACE_ME>",
  "messagingSenderId": "<REPLACE_ME>"
}
```

1. Import initial data to the Firebase Database
  - Generate `serviceAccount.json` file
    - Go to [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com) -> Project settings -> Service accounts
    - Ensure that **Node.js** is selected and press **Generate new private key**
    - Read the warning and press **Generate key**
    - Save the file as `serviceAccount.json` and to the root of your hoverboard directory (❗Do NOT commit this file to the public repository)
    - Enable Firestore in web console at [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com) -> Database -> Cloud Firestore -> Create database. Select **locked mode** and press **Enable**
	- [Optional] You can edit `docs/default-firebase-data.json)` file using your own data
	- Select your Firebase project `npx firebase use <YOUR_PROJECT_ID>`
    * Run `npm run firestore:init` or `yarn firestore:init`

1. Whoa! You've set up Firebase into your app.
