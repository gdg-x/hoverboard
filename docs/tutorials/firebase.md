# Configure your app with Firebase

In case to have Authentication and My Schedule features, you'll need a Firebase project and your specific configuration data that has a few details about your project.

1. Create a Firebase project in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/), if you don't already have one.

	- If you already have an existing Google project associated with your app, click *Import Google Project*. Otherwise, click *Create New Project*.
	- If you already have a Firebase project, click *Add App* from the project overview page.

2. Click *Add Firebase to your web app*.
3. Note the initialization code snippet, which you will use in a minute.

	The **snippet contains initialization** information to configure the Firebase JavaScript SDK to use [Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/), [Storage](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage/) and the [Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/). 

	- YOUR_APP_NAME - The Firebase Project name
	- YOUR_FIREBASE_DOMAIN - The Firebase domain
	- YOUR_FIREBASE_DATABASE - The Firebase Realtime Database (for storing users' schedule)
	- YOUR_API_KEY - Web API Key

4. *Copy* all needed data, then paste it in `data/hoverboard.config.json`. This configuration looks like this:

	```
	"firebase": {
		"name": "<YOUR_APP_NAME>",
		"domain": "YOUR_FIREBASE_DOMAIN",
		"database": "<YOUR_FIREBASE_DATABASE>",
		"api": "<YOUR_API_KEY>",
		"userSessionsPath": "/userSessions",
		"ratingsPath": "/ratings",
		"indexedDbSession": "hoverboard"
	}
	```
	
5. Import data to the Firebase Database. You can use [default-firebase-data.json](../default-firebase-data.json) schema and then update it with your information.

6. Whoa! You've set up Firebase into your app.
