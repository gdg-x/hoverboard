Let’s jump onboard on this journey and walk through different techniques that can help us keep our code sane and healthy for better scalability.\nDisclaimer: This talk is going to be focused from a mobile standpoint but most of the practices included can also be applied to any software project under development.",

Flux and/or Redux?\nIn this talk, we will talk about how to follow the principles that architectures like Flux and Redux do on the web, but on Android.\nWhat is a state? store? dispatcher? side effect? controller view? How do we glue all these parts together? How to keep our domain isolated from the outer world so is easily testable? how do we chain actions? how do keep everything unidirectional?\nWe will cover all these topics and much more!!, and you know what? everything with a bit of Kotlin sauce, so we will see how we can take advantage of the cool stuff this language provide us to make our architecture even better.",

If you answered yes to any of these questions, you need fastlane!\nfastlane is a collection of tools that enables mobile developers to automate many of the common tasks that are necessary to create a continuous deployment pipeline. In this talk I will show you how fastlane works, show you an overview of the features that fastlane supports and give you an introduction to the DSL used to create these pipelines. After this talk you should be equipped with all the information you need to implement fastlane in your own apps.",
