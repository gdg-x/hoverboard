## Guide for Contributors

Hoverboard are built in the open, and the GDG[x] team eagerly encourage any and all forms of community contribution. When contributing, please follow these guidelines:

### Filing Issues

**If you are filing an issue to request a feature**, please provide a clear description of the feature. It can be helpful to describe answers to the following questions:

 1. **Who will use the feature?** _“As someone filling out a form…”_
 2. **When will they use the feature?** _“When I enter an invalid value…”_
 3. **What is the user’s goal?** _“I want to be visually notified that the value needs to be corrected…”_

**If you are filing an issue to report a bug**, please provide:

 1. **A clear description of the bug and related expectations.** Consider using the following example template for reporting a bug:

 ```markdown
 
 The `paper-foo` element causes the page to turn pink when clicked.

 ## Expected outcome

 The page stays the same color.

 ## Actual outcome

 The page turns pink.

 ## Steps to reproduce

 1. Put a `paper-foo` element in the page.
 2. Open the page in a web browser.
 3. Click the `paper-foo` element.
 
 ```

 3. **A list of browsers where the problem occurs.** This can be skipped if the problem is the same across all browsers.

### Submitting Pull Requests

**Before creating a pull request**, please ensure that an issue exists for the corresponding change in the pull request that you intend to make. **If an issue does not exist, please create one per the guidelines above**. The goal is to discuss the design and necessity of the proposed change with Polymer authors and community before diving into a pull request.

When submitting pull requests, please provide:

 1. **A reference to the corresponding issue** or issues that will be closed by the pull request. Please refer to these issues in the pull request description using the following syntax:

 ```markdown
 (For a single issue)
 Fixes #20

 (For multiple issues)
 Fixes #32, fixes #40
 ```

 2. **A succinct description of the design** used to fix any related issues. For example:

 ```markdown
 This fixes #20 by removing styles that leaked which would cause the page to turn pink whenever `paper-foo` is clicked.
 ```

 3. **At least one test for each bug fixed or feature added** as part of the pull request. Pull requests that fix bugs or add features without accompanying tests will not be considered.

If a proposed change contains multiple commits, please [squash commits](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://blog.steveklabnik.com/posts/2012-11-08-how-to-squash-commits-in-a-github-pull-request) to as few as is necessary to succinctly express the change. A Polymer author can help you squash commits, so don’t be afraid to ask us if you need help with that!

## Financial contributions

We also welcome financial contributions in full transparency on our [open collective](https://opencollective.com/hoverboard).
Anyone can file an expense. If the expense makes sense for the development of the community, it will be "merged" in the ledger of our open collective by the core contributors and the person who filed the expense will be reimbursed.
