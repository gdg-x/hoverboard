Ukrainian city of Lviv is no doubt one of the most charming and yet not well-known parts of Ukraine. It’s been recently gaining plenty of attention from the world, and was proudly featured on [BBC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkK93bCIofk&list=FLSdbB5_2f0i17sH1Bo-WR9A&index=1&feature=plpp_video) and [EuroNews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkK93bCIofk&list=FLSdbB5_2f0i17sH1Bo-WR9A&index=1&feature=plpp_video). City’s impressive architecture, absense of large tourist crowds and unique combination of rustiness and timelessness bring out a very special charm, capturing the hearts of everyone who’s ever visited it.

# **Take bird view photos of Lviv from the High Castle hill**
<img src="/images/posts/lviv7.jpg" style="width: 100%;"/>

Lviv High Castle can be both a major disappointment and biggest surprise to you! Why disappointment? Because despite its promising name, the place is not that high (unless 413 m is impressive for you) and has no castle whatsoever. Why surprise? Because it offers a quiet refuge from the busy city streets, and it has indubitably the best aerial views of the city! The hill, also known as Vysoky Zamok, used to be a wooden fortress, built in the 13th century by King Lev.
**Where to find:** High Castle (Vysokyi Zamok) is located just outside Lviv’s center inside Vysokyi Zamok Park. There are no direct transport links to the park, so wear good shoes and  enjoy the 15-20-minute walk from the center.  Just follow the small brown signs.
**When to visit:** sunny weather is the best for great bird view of the city
**How much to pay:** for FREE
