The lack of diversity in terms of gender is well documented in the technology industry. Public data shared by major tech employers show that women only represent **25-45%** of their entire workforce. The disparity gets worse in technical roles - for the past 5 years, women have been stuck at [21 percent of technical roles][21percent]

Women fill many roles in marketing, HR, finance and other departments in the tech industry. This is a positive trend, but it’s never going to be enough to close the gender gap in the industry. Why? Because the biggest job growth at nearly all companies is happening in technical roles.

## It’s 2016. Every Company is a Tech Company.
Today, every company is a tech company, and every industry relies on tech to drive efficiency and innovation. Getting more women and underrepresented groups into technical roles is the key to closing the gender gap.
Why is the technical workforce in particular so important? To illustrate, let’s look at a well-known technology player in Silicon Valley, Intel, which released its [Diversity and Inclusion Annual Report][intelreport] earlier this year.

> *As of 2015, women make up **24.8%** *of the company’s overall  workforce. By contrast, women make up only 20.1% of Intel’s technical workforce. (For context, technical roles make up a whopping **86%**  *of Intel’s entire workforce.)*

This prevailing attitude, and the resulting lack of women in tech, is discouraging. But despite these challenges, we must recognize the great strides women have made in business, leadership and society. For instance, this year, more than half the finalists for Intel’s Science Talent Search were women, and two of the three winners were female.

## Diversity leads to better products and results
Women represent half of the world’s intellectual capital and their participation can substantially expand economic growth. Ignoring this fact can be disastrous for organizations. To succeed in a fast-paced, hyper-competitive global marketplace, companies must innovate continuously. **And nothing drives innovation like diversity.** Recruiting, retaining and advancing women technologists isn’t just the right thing to do — *it’s the smart thing to do*.

> *According the [MIT study][mitstudy] and many more to be found online, diversity improves performance, morale, and the end product. More women engineers means building a better Internet, and improving software that can service society as a whole.*

## Female Discount for GDG DevFest Ukraine 2016
As a sizable event of *Google technologies in Ukraine*, our team found it in part our responsibility to encourage diversity at [GDG DevFest Ukraine 2016][dfua]. We’ve taken three distinct approaches:

* Providing women an extra opportunity to obtain much wanted tickets to increase female attendance (the **promo code** for **18%** off is - **WomenInTechDFUA16**);
* Arranging for [Women Techmakers Ukraine][wtm] members to address this topic during the conference;
* Encouraging women to speak up and be role models to inspire others.

**And to women: speak up!** Get involved with events like [DevFest][dfua] by submitting an abstract of a topic that you’re passionate about, or volunteer to participate in organizing community events like these.
