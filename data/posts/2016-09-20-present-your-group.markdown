The core idea of the event is to get introduced to all neighbour organizers and make new friends, so _each attending GDG chapter must prepare a small presentation_ to introduce themselves.

Presentation should be maximum 2 minutes long - so be fun and creative. Things you could mention: who are the chapter leads, what kind of events do you do, what are your proudest achievements, what is your chapter history and more. Try to think what could be valuable for other organizers to know about you and be creative!

To save some time not changing computer for each chapter (_and we have a whooping 30 chapters registered to the Summit!_) please cooperate with other GDG chapters from your country and glue them into one presentation per country.

Please prepare the country glued presentation until 4th of October. Regarding where to send them, we will have a dedicated place for that very soon.
