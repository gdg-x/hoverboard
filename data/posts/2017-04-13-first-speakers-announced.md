            Welcome Martin Splitt. Perhaps everyone who attended last year's DevFest remembers Martin â€” his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRXLs-Ccj2o">practical sessions</a>, seasoned with the brilliant sense of humor, were absolute hits!

            No wonder we are so excited he will be joining us this year too :) Btw, Martin is a freshly baked Google Developer Expert in Web technologies, do not hesitate to greet him on <a href="https://twitter.com/g33konaut">Twitter</a>!
