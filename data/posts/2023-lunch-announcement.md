As many people know, 2023 is a rebuilding year for many community oriented events like ours. We’ve had a difficult time finding sponsors this year and we want to prioritize delivering the best programming.

We also want to help our local Philadelphia community rebuild as well. Instead of offering a catered lunch, we’ll be providing attendees with $20/day gift cards to check out the restaurants in Old City.

This is definitely new for us and we’re hoping that this process goes smoothly. Similar to previous years, we’ll be looking forward to your feedback on this approach and appreciate your patience as we rebuild.

At registration, we’ll provide an easy to read map along with restaurant recommendations. We will still have breakfast catered as well as beverages available throughout the day.

Thank you!

The LibertyJS Organizing Team
