FOSS4G SotM Oceania offers a Travel Grant Program (similar to the [OSGeo TGP](https://www.osgeo.org/initiatives/foss4g-travel-grant-program/)) aimed at increasing the diversity, accessibility, and reach of the conference. We want to support worthy recipients who are interested in gaining in-depth insight into development and application of open-source geospatial software and are committed to making an impact in their home country, given the opportunity provided.

### What we are looking for:

- People from the Oceania region*, who wouldn't be able to attend without funding assistance
- People from under-represented communities, such as:    
  - Indigenous communities        
  - Residents of remote communities        
  - Women and minority genders        
  - Community development workers or students who don't have workplace or government funding        
- People who have "skin in the game":    
  - People who will use what they learn to positively impact themselves and their communities
  - People who already contribute to open communities, such as contributing to OpenStreetMap, or Open Source Software
  - People willing to volunteer at the conference or present a talk at the conference

### What is on offer:

There are three tiers of grant available to assist with eligible travel expenses:
- Tier 1: free conference & workshop registration, plus up to NZD $2000
- Tier 2: free conference & workshop registration, plus up to NZD $1000
- Tier 3: free conference & workshop registration

All successful applicants will be provided with free registration to 1 day of workshops (12th Nov) and the 2 day conference (13-14 Nov). Community Day (15 Nov) will be free for everybody. Lunch will be provided on all 4 days.

The number of grants available is dependent on the generosity of our sponsors and may be adjusted depending on the level of funding raised and the number of applications received.

### More:

- We're defining the Oceania region as those countries within the [United Nations geoscheme for Oceania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_geoscheme_for_Oceania), with the addition of West Papua and Timor-Leste.
- Eligible travel expenses include transportation, accommodation, and visa costs.
Please help us extend this program as widely as possible by applying for the smallest grant size that will adequately meet your needs.
- We ask that you pay for your expenses up front, and we will reimburse you at the conference. You may be asked to provide receipts or similar evidence of expenditure.
- You will need to be in possession of a valid entry visa (if required).
