## Introduction

DevFest Hamburg is a community-driven conference for developers of all experience levels and background.

As a community-driven conference, we want everybody to feel welcome, regardless of gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, disabilites or physical appearance. We do not tolerate harassment of any kind.

_Everyone_ (including speakers, sponsors, and staff) is required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers and volunteers will enforce this code throughout the event.

## Incident Handling

Staff and organisers will follow the [incident handling procedures](/incident-handling).
If you are an attendee, you can find help for reporting Code of Conduct violations [here](violation-reporting).

## Overview

**Be kind to others.** We are all part of the same community, and everyone deserves to be here just as much as you, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, or anything else. Be friendly and welcoming to others. Do not insult, harass or demean other people.

**Be inclusive.** Keep in mind that your words, no matter how well-intentioned, can inadvertently hurt people who do not share your background or opinion. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate, and so are sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes. Try your best to avoid assumptions about other people's professions, roles, or skill levels.

**Speak up.** If you or someone else are being harassed, do not hesitate to contact the event staff (organizers or volunteers), who can be identified by special badges or attire.
While we do our best to notice any case of harassment, we rely on your help and would greatly appreciate it. If you feel uncomfortable reporting a violation in person, please do so at team@devfest.de.
You may want to take a look at the [violation reporting guidelines for attendees](/violation-reporting) before submitting a report: it is not mandatory, but might help us handle the situation better and faster.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.

## Details

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Exhibitors in the hallways, sponsor or vendor booths, or similar activities are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment. The same policy applies to online harrassment.

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Excessive swearing is not appropriate for DevFest Hamburg either.

If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including expelling the offender from the conference with no refund.

The conference organizers will maintain the anonymity of the offended party, unless specifically discussed and agreed not to, as well as the anonymity of the alleged offender during an ongoing investigation.

The conference organizers will follow the [incident handling guidelines for staff](/incident-handling).
