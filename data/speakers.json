With a diverse background in both the corporate world and entrepreneurship, I bring a unique perspective to my work.\n During my time building my former company, Gas Hoppers USA, I was dedicated to helping businesses save on fuel costs by eliminating middlemen. Through our innovative mobile app, companies could monitor usage, achieve savings, and experience unmatched reliability, quality, and communication.\n My journey continued at Lambda School's rigorous 18-month Computer Science & Software Engineering Academy, where industry giants like Y-Combinator, Google Ventures, and Stripe provided support. There, I immersed myself in full-stack web development, mastering Python, Django, JavaScript, React, Redux, Node.js, and other cutting-edge technologies. I built intricate applications and embraced modern JavaScript environments and tooling.\n Now, as a Software Development Engineer, I thrive on tackling complex challenges and empowering others in the tech industry. I'm thrilled to connect with the LibertyJS community, sharing my expertise and insights. Let's embark on an exploration of the captivating world of building scalable and resilient apps with AWS and CI/CD pipelines.",
