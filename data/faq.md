## Mission and Values  
  
### Mission Statement  
  
RadicalxChange convenes a community of activists, artists, entrepreneurs and scholars committed to using dramatically expanded competitive, free and open market mechanisms to reduce inequality, build widely-shared prosperity, heal global political divides and build a richer and more cooperative social life. As advocates of radical social change, the RadicalxChange community challenges long-established social institutions such as private property, one-person-one-vote and the primacy of the individual on the one hand and the nation state on the other. To achieve this change the community seeks to increase public knowledge about the emancipatory potential of insights from the field of mechanism design, in dialog with a range of other academic fields such as computer science, philosophy and history, the communicative imagination of artists, the pragmatic ingenuity of entrepreneurs and the idealism of activists for social justice.
  
### Core Values

 - **Open**: RadicalxChange is open. It seeks to facilitate a free exchange of ideas in an environment of thoughtful discourse.
 - **Egalitarian**: Many of the ideas at RadicalxChange are animated by a belief that hyper-concentrations of wealth are not natural or efficient, and that a more genuinely competitive market system would result in a broader distribution of wealth.
 - **Dignity**: Every person’s well-being (financial or otherwise) is a good in itself. We want our work to reflect and express this.
 - **Social Innovation**: At RadicalxChange we embrace the challenge of overturning stale categories and assumptions! We believe that thoughtful, collaborative innovation can help build better social institutions.

### Governance Principles

 - **Diversity**: To build a truly broad-based and effective community, we include the insights and perspectives of a wide range of social interests, political backgrounds, identity groups and vocational expertise. Leaders at all levels of RadicalxChange strive to actively include people within their remit who differ from them along all these dimensions but share the mission.
 - **Decentralization**: RadicalxChange is fundamentally anti-authoritarian in outlook and seeks to be the change it wishes to promote. Leaders at all levels of RadicalxChange strive to push decision-making authority outward to the extent possible, recognizing the substantial informal authority they hold as leaders and seeking primarily to include and draw upon members of the community wherever possible rather than aggregating decision-making authority in their own hands.
 - **Responsibility**: RadicalxChange leaders are chosen for their expertise in their respective areas of responsibility and take responsibility for ensuring engagement, quality decision-making, fair representation of their domain externally and the consistency of internal participation and governance with other RadicalxChange principles.
 - **Social Justice Mission**: RadicalxChange is primarily devoted to achieving its social justice mission, rather than achieving the private goals of any member. RadicalxChange should not become a source of personal enrichment for any individual to the exclusion of the community.
 - **Respect**: RadicalxChange community members treat each other as epistemic and social equals and should aim to empathize with the intellectual and personal perspective each member of the community brings to the table.

  
## Our Community  
    
### Community Overview  
  

RadicalxChange is an inclusive, open community that seeks to promote rich and meaningful connections across a wide range of people from all walks of life. We believe in diversity of opinion and representation across different ethnicities and races, genders and sexual orientations, religions, nationalities, and socio-economic and professional backgrounds.

  
We have four primary ‘tracks’ in our community, across which we actively promote dialogue and the xChange of ideas, passions, partnered experimentations and building - namely, Activism and Government, Arts and Communications, Entrepreneurship and Technology and Ideas and Research.
  
### Local Chapters and Meetups

RadicalxChange chapters are self-organized community groups working to educate and experiment with egalitarian market mechanisms.  Finding or founding a local chapter is a great way to learn and contribute to the ongoing conversation.  Please note that RadicalxChange Foundation Ltd. does not direct, and is not responsible for, the actions or events of local chapters or chapter organizers.
