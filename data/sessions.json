Some common questions I hear when talking to others are: What are they? How do you use them? Do they replace life-cycle methods and/or class components completely? We will go over all of these together. I'll start with a basic React app using a few stateful, class components using life-cycle methods, custom methods and API interaction. I will then convert the components over to functional ones while integrating several different hooks, without losing any functionality. Finally, we will look into some common \"gotchas\" that may be confusing for people starting out with hooks. You will come away from this talk with a good foundation for various primitive hooks in React, and you'll understand how they're used and how you can start to write your own custom hooks.",

What if you could use machine learning to help you keep up with all of the changes? While it’s far from taking all of the programming jobs, machine learning can help developers make more user-friendly web applications. With the use of Brain.js, you can do text prediction, make small layout changes, check for malicious users, and more. In this talk, attendees will learn some background on machine learning and algorithms and see examples of where Brain.js can be used in real applications. We’ll cover business cases in web development where machine learning can help, how neural networks work, and how JavaScript can be used to train a model and make real-time updates for users.

We’ll look at how we’re using Web Components to share code between sites and if they can be used to share components between frameworks. I’ll go over how we’re sharing data between codebases with Redux. Lastly we’ll talk about Shared Flows; pulling out complicated reusable logic into its own microsite.

We will give you a buggy application that you’ll have to fix before adding new features to it using either Vue.js or React. How fast will you go? Will you share your findings with other developers? You’re welcome to test this during our workshop. We have built the same application with ReactJS and Vue.js. We invite you to spend the session learning how to build such an app yourself with the help of our mentors. By the end of the session, you should be able to answer these questions: • What is Functional Reactive Programming? • How to use React and Vue.js?

How do we know if we’re doing ‘mentoring’ right, and what small things do we not know about that could be doing more harm than good? Through my work as over the past 3 years directing mentors at a monthly coding class, I’ve been able to compile effective methods through research and experience that will help all developers be better mentors, whether within an established mentor/mentee relationship or just in quick day-to-day teaching opportunities. By setting expectations, learning how to be more friendly and accessible, removing roadblocks, practicing self-care, developing empathy for mentees, and constantly iterating based on actionable feedback, we can all contribute to creating richer tech communities that thrive on constant improvement and collective growth.",

Also, this presentation will contribute to you your attendees with fostering a positive change and cultivate a more inviting place of work. This presentation will discuss the impacts of diversity collectively using identifying what variety can be combined with how it affects a business. The presentation will assist with explaining what it signifies being an inclusive place of work, offer comprehensive measures to assess best what degree one’s place of work fosters inclusion a and diversity. The workshop, through means of role-playing scenarios, present ways you can take to impact positive philosophies at your place of work.

For websites in particular, deploying code is often done behind the scenes without a user having to install an update since each new connection can be fulfilled with the latest version of the site. Having complete control of this process allows us to be creative in how fast or slow we deploy code in order to optimize for either maintainability of the code base, getting features out fast, or even both. While deployments seemingly look like a trivial final step, how we deploy code has far flung effects on how we write code. We will examine how each deployment strategy affects how developers produce code so that we can make an informed decision on the tradeoffs.",

Let’s build accessibility testing into your workflow, and prevent common errors from even being committed in the first place.

Shape Up helped 37signals manage periods of extensive growth and a rewrite of their flagship product from scratch for its 2.0 release. <br><br> In the Foreword to Singer's book, “Shape Up: Stop Running in Circles and Ship Work that Matters,” 37signals CEO Jason Fried explains that Shape Up does not require “daily stand ups, design sprints, development sprints, or anything remotely tied to a metaphor that includes being tired and worn out at the end. No backlogs, no Kanban, no velocity tracking, none of that.”<br><br> So what does “Shape Up” involve? <br><br> In this talk, Pinnacle 21 CTO Martin Snyder will cover the basics of this novel approach and share lessons learned from years of practice. <br><br> Pinnacle 21 is an early adopter of Shape Up and has scaled its implementation from a 30-person startup to being part of a 100+ person R&D organization at Certara, the company that acquired Pinnacle in 2021.",
